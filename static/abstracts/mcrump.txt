Abstract: The purpose of this project is to fabricate monolayers of gold and cadmium selenide nanoparticles with conducting ligands for applications in solid state devices. To fabricate such nanoparticles, a new ligand exchange procedure will be developed (1). Nanoparticles with organic, insulating ligands in hexane will be exchanged with thiocyanate ligands in solution via mixing the two solutions together. Thiocyanate ligands dissolved in acetone shows promise, but other solutions will be tested. UV and IR spectroscopy will performed to confirm that the reaction occurred successfully. Then, various techniques to form monolayers will be investigated and optimized. Four-point probe tests will be performed on the films to determine their conductivity. In the future, if these monolayers of nanoparticles can be fabricated successfully, various solid state applications, especially solar cells, will be explored, by combining these nanoparticles with either organic or inorganic layers to form such devices.

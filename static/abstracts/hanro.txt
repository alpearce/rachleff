Abstract: Controlled release of macromolecules from several classes of nanoparticles has been explored as a precursor to medical agent delivery. The types of nanoparticles under investigation include dendrimers, gold nanoparticles, and silica nanospheres. Modifications to the surface chemistry of these particles allow scientists to bestow specific release properties to the structures. The topic of controlled release of therapeutic and biological molecules from mesoporous silica nanospheres (MSNs) has been explored extensively in recent years. MSNs are biocompatible, have suitable surface area and pore volume, and allow effective incorporation of biomedical agents. Although MSNs show enormous potential for targeted drug delivery applications, much work is still needed to explore its properties. MSNs are capable of providing controlled release of incorporated molecules with some initial burst release. To eliminate this initial burst release and achieve better control, the surface of MSNs loaded with relevant molecules will be functionalized with a thin layer of the biopolymer chitosan. Presence of the chitosan layer on the surface of MSNs will help to eliminate the initial burst release and achieve better control over the complete release profile of encapsulated biological agents. Fluorescent dextran molecules of two molecular weights (20 kDa and 70 kDa) will be used as models for large biological agents such as growth factors and proteins. After immersing the dextran containing nanoparticles in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), elution samples will be taken at constant time intervals to determine the amount of dextran released. Dextran concentrations will be calculated using UV-Vis spectroscopy, and a control group of nanoparticles with no chitosan coating will allow determination of the effects of the chitosan layer.

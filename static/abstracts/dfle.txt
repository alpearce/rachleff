Abstract: Micro/Nano ElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS/NEMS) devices such as resonators, filters and switches have been successfully employed as high performance components for RF communication, logic and sensing applications. In particular, MEMS/NEMS resonators can be configured as high performance gravimetric sensors capable of detecting concentrations of volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) in the subparts per billion range. A fundamental step in the configuration of MEMS/NEMS resonators as gravimetric sensors for the detection of VOCs is the functionalization of the device with a chemically interactive material (CIM) capable of selectively adsorbing different gas molecules on the resonator surface (i.e. changing its mass). In this work, single strand DNA sequences are employed as CIMs for nanoscale gravimetric sensors based on ultra-thin film (250 nm) AlN Contour-Mode resonant sensors (CMR-S). In order to increase the overall selectivity, large arrays of CMR-S need to be fabricated in which each resonant element is functionalized with a different DNA sequence. The capability of accurately dispensing the DNA solution on the top surface of a single NEMS resonator (area ~50x200 ?m2) is of crucial importance. The simple use of a micro pipet to dispense the solution turns out to be inaccurate and can cause contamination of devices by multiple DNA solutions, even when using a motorized pipet. In this work we propose to use a Fujifilm Dimatix Materials Printer to print patterns of 10pL drops directly onto the CMR-S NEMS array. After accurate optimization of the printing technique, solution drops with a diameter of 20 ?m and a positioning error of <5 ?m can be produced, which enables the capability to dispense the DNA solution on the surface of a single NEMS CMR-S. This method eliminates the cross-contamination of adjacent devices and proves to be far more accurate than using a simple micro pipet.

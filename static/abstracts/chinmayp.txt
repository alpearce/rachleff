Abstract: Rationale: Airway inflammation is a hallmark feature of bronchial asthma, the primary respiratory disease afflicting children. Carbenoxolone (CBX) is a potent inhibitor of 11ß hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11ß-HSD). We previously demonstrated that administration of CBX to asthmatic rabbits abrogated airway inflammation and hyper-reactivity, hallmark features of asthma. 11ß-HSD1 activates cortisone to bioactive cortisol while 11ß-HSD2 catalyzes the reverse reaction. Additionally, eosinophils, the primary leukocytes implicated in bronchial asthma, are known to be recruited to the airway epithelium via the release of eotaxin-3 (CCL26). In light of this evidence, this study tested the hypothesis that CBX, by blocking 11ß-HSD1 and 11ß-HSD2 allows for higher levels of endogenous active glucocorticoid (GC). Active GC, in turn, may inhibit the release of eotaxin-3, thus potentially blocking inflammation associated with proasthmatic changes in epithelium elicited by IL-13, the principle Th2 cytokine implicated in allergic asthma. Findings: IL-13 treated epithelial cells exhibited decreased 11ß-HSD1 activity and increased eotaxin-3 release. Co-treatment with CBX led to marked decrease in eotaxin-3 release only in the presence of active GC. Conclusions: Taken together, these data suggest that eotaxin-3 release is inversely correlated with active GC level. In the presence of active GC, eotaxin-3 release is markedly decreased, thus suggesting that CBX, by inhibiting 11ß-HSD2, may allow for heightened levels of active GC, thus inhibiting eotaxin-3 release. Accordingly, the findings suggest that interventions targeted at inhibiting 11ß-HSD2 may yield effective new approaches to prevent asthmatic airway inflammation.

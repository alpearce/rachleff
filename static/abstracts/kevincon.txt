Abstract: Commuters spend an average of 80 minutes a day in automobiles [1]. Travelers are increasingly using their car as a mobile office, mobile meeting room, and mobile living room. With this evolution, the informational and entertainment needs within the vehicle are transcending mechanical, electronic, and software boundaries to the services offered for the driver, passengers and also the vehicle. Currently the time for an automotive manufacturer to develop a new car averages 33.9 months [2] and during that time the electronics and software of existing vehicles are 'frozen'. This long production cycle creates rigid in-vehicle infotainment and electronics that are often obsolete by the time the vehicle is in full-production. To address these concerns, vehicles are to become more programmable so that almost every aspect from the engine control, cabin comfort, connectivity, navigation, and safety will be remotely upgradeable and, by design, evolve over the lifetime of the vehicle. The architecture outlined in this article seamlessly integrates third-party hardware devices (i.e. sensors, actuators) and software modules (i.e. controllers, visualization and diagnostics) within the automotive for increased safety, vehicle prognostics, real-time congestion-aware navigation, and comfort. The architecture is component based and consists of a hardware-based interface to monitor and control the vehicle?s internal computer and a network software-based interface to allow for plug-n-play module integration during the lifetime of the vehicle.

Abstract: Classical physics outlines exactly what to expect when two objects interact. The hypothesis posed here is whether simple frictional interactions between two objects can be modeled accurately by small changes in the accelerations of the objects. This falls generally under the field of haptics, the study of the sense of touch. The proposed project involves the use of a stylus to record the physical feel of an object so it can be recreated in virtual space. This virtual modeling of physical objects is referred to as haptography. The stylus contains a high-frequency spring which allows it to measure small changes in friction. From collecting large samples of data, software will be written which takes the raw data and extrapolates to what the object most likely resembles. Afterwards, the stylus will then be excited to recreate the frictional forces felt for the object. In essence, an object is taken from the real world, given a virtual model, and then used to simulate the original object.

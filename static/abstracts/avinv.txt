Abstract: The goal of this research is to elucidate why deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) results in an antidepressant effect. This will be accomplished by analyzing the circuits targeted by DBS using optogenetic, and behavioral tools, and will have applications in enhancing current DBS treatments and developing new antidepressants. The intellectual merit of this project derives from its original nature, advancement of molecular neuroscience, and the experience of this research group. Although previous groups have attempted to elucidate DBS’ mechanism of action, research has generally utilized lesioning of tissue and biochemical analysis (Hamani, 2010). No research has investigated this mechanism using optogenetic tools. Determining the effect of DBS on the circuits relevant to depression in this way will advance the field of molecular neuroscience by elucidating the pathway connecting the mPFC to the dorsal raphe (DR) region of the brain, and how it responds to stimulation. We have three years of experience applying optogenetics specifically to DR neurons. I have investigated the response of DR neurons to a knockout of histone deacetylase-6 (HDAC6), which resulted in a full-time research grant and a paper being submitted to Nature Neuroscience.

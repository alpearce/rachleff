Abstract: The proposed work will focus on the fabrication and characterization of nanofibrous three-dimensional polymeric composite structures that can be used as implantable devices to help repair damaged soft tissues of the human body. This work will be done in the McKay Orthopaedic Research Laboratories under the guidance of Dr. Robert Mauck. Dr. Mauck's group has been working in the area of tissue engineering for several years and has focused on applications specific to the intervertebral disc of the spine and meniscus in the knee. Daniel Zhou will investigate the addition of silk onto nanofibrous composite scaffolds, as well as the tuned delivery of TGF-ß and dexamethasone from the scaffold to aid in the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the rat model to produce a potential functional replacement of fibrocartilaginous tissue.

Abstract: Lipid bilayer membranes mediate many cellular functions, which makes them an important area of study. Of particular interest are peripheral proteins and their interactions with lipid bilayers. Recent experiments have suggested that endophilin through its Bin Amphiphysin Rvs (BAR) domain plays a role in inducing and sensing membrane curvature in the process of clathrin mediated vesicle endocytosis. Clathrin mediated endocytosis is important to many biological processes including the retrieval of synaptic vesicles after neurotransmission. However, endophilin's exact role and mechanism of action is not completely understood. It has been suggested in previous studies that endophilin forms a rigid, crescent shaped dimer that allows it to sense or drive curvature by pressing its form onto membranes. One problem that will be investigated is whether or not dimerization is promoted by membrane binding for endophilin via forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments. Another problem that will be investigated is what causes the time dependent increase of tryptophan-DPH FRET, a mechanism of energy transfer that is highly dependent on distance, between A66W endophilin N-BAR and vesicles containing DPH.

Abstract: In many cellular contexts, a cell must make a binary decision based on a graded extracellular input. Cells accomplish this via "switch-like" signaling networks, which convert a graded input stimulus into an all-or-none response. An important component of this switch-like behavior is ultrasensitivity, the ability of a network to produce an abrupt change in response at a threshold stimulus concentration. We studied ultrasensitivity computationally and experimentally in a simple signaling network, in which catalytic activation of a substrate led to synthesis of the inactive substrate. We used differential equations to model the system mathematically, investigating the effects of various physiological parameters on ultrasensitivity. We also introduced a mechanism for regulating basal concentration of inactive substrate in an experimental network; this concentration may be able to increase ultrasensitivity in a manner comparable to that of transcriptional feedback. The experimental work remains in progress, but preliminary computational results indicate unexpected behavior that could signify a new mechanism for producing ultrasensitivity. Insight into the generation of ultrasensitivity could lead to greater understanding of its occurrence in nature, and inform its implementation in synthetic circuits.

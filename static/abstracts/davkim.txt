Abstract: Vertically aligned nanotube arrays made of silica nanoparticles were prepared as specimens for in-situ micro-compression testing. Nanotube arrays were synthesized using the sacrificial template method; they were assembled by the layer-by-layer deposition of oppositely charged silica nanoparticles in the pores of track-etched polycarbonate membranes. When the track-etched polycarbonate membranes were dissolved, arrays of free-standing nanotubes with smooth and welldefined walls were revealed. Despite the lack of directional uniformity among the nanotubes, nanotubes that are aligned perpendicular to the surface of the substrate can be picked out and used as specimens for in-situ micro-compression testing subsequently. The results of the micro-compression tests will lead to a better characterization of the layer-by-layer assembled nanoparticles thin films, thereby giving us more control over different design considerations when engineering applications of the LbL films.

Abstract: Head trauma is the leading cause of death and severe injury in children and adolescents. Previous studies suggest that biomarkers may be used to differentiate between patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and those without brain injury. The antibodies SMI31, SM32 and SMI35 have proven successful in recognizing a three-component neural biomarker panel of dephospho-neurofilament H, hyperphospho-neurofilament H, and hypophospho-neurofilament H in human cerebral spinal fluid. We hypothesized that this three-component biomarker panel would be successful in differentiating between brain injured animals and uninjured shams. Three injured groups were studied: one moderate injury (single sagittal rotation) and two mild injuries (focal lesion and cyclic repeated injury). We compared levels of the three biomarkers in blood serum samples obtained from 3 to 5 day old piglets before injury and 24 hours postinjury between the cyclic repeated injuries (n=7), the focal lesion injuries (n=12) and the sagittal rotation injuries (n=5). SMI31, 32 and 35 levels were all significantly elevated (p<.05) 24 hours post injury for focal lesion injuries, and SMI31 levels were significantly elevated (p<.05) in sagittal rotation injuries. No significant biomarker differences were seen in cyclic injured groups.

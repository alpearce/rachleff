    The Rachleff Scholars program offers Penn Engineering undergraduates the opportunity to gain valuable research experiences 
    with standing faculty and to participate in a community of peers who 
    share a common interest in research and scholarly inquiry. It 
    includes two major aspects:
  </p>
  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
    <li>A ten-week paid Summer Research Experience, typically after the completion of a student's
    sophomore year. This experience will be completed under the mentorship of a University of
    Pennsylvania Faculty member.</li>
    <li>Several credit-bearing courses prior to and following the Summer Research Experience.</li>
  </ol>

    About the Society
  </h3>
  <p>
    The Rachleff Scholars Society, founded in 2011, is a group dedicated to fostering community within the Rachleff Scholars Program. 
    Our goals are to improve the camaraderie within the RSS community and provide guidance and support to underclassmen Rachleff 
    Scholars. The activities hosted by the organization range from academic guest speakers discussing their research to social events 
    such as baseball games and barbecues.
